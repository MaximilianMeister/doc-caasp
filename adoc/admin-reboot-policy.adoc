=== Completely disable reboots

If you would like to take care about reboots manually, either temporary or in general, you can disable those by creating a lock:
----
kubectl -n kube-system annotate ds kured weave.works/kured-node-lock='{"nodeID":"manual"}'
----

=== Manual unlock

In exceptional circumstances, such as a node experiencing a permanent failure whilst rebooting, manual intervention may be required to remove the cluster lock:
----
kubectl -n kube-system annotate ds kured weave.works/kured-node-lock-
----
